# TfL-bike-rental-analysis

This paper assesses how Transport for London (TfL) can boost bike rentals year-round by investigating the impact of weather and calendar variables on rental trends. The dataset allowed analysis of important variables (temperature, humidity, windspeed, season, weekends, and holidays) to understand their influence on rental patterns. An exploratory analysis suggested strong seasonal variations, with the most frequent rentals in summer and the least in winter. Statistical tests revealed TfL could expect fewer than 35,000 daily rentals on over 70\% of business days, showing significant differences between seasons. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) verified rental variability between seasons, while a Welch t-test showed no significant difference between weekends and weekdays. Power analysis suggested a larger dataset to avoid potential Type II errors. To quantify the variables' influence on rental counts, a multiple linear regression model was used. After stepwise selection, the final model accounted for approximately 74\% of rental variability, with significant predictors being temperature, humidity, windspeed, holidays, and weekends. 

Analysis indicated that higher windspeed and humidity correlated with decreased rentals, while higher temperatures were associated with increased usage. These results imply that TfL could improve year-round rental profits by targeting strategies towards weather conditions, such as promotions based on seasonality or advertising cycling gear for adverse weather, to stabilize rentals year-round and maintain steady usage between seasons.
